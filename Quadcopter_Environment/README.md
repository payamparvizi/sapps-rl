## Installation Instructions

This project uses a Linux operating system with Python 3.9.20. 

To get started, it is recommended to [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) on your laptop or PC. Once Anaconda is installed, follow the steps below:

### 1. Create and activate the environment:

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

  ```bash
  conda create --name crazyflie_env python=3.9.20
  conda activate crazyflie_env

  ```

### 2. Install Related Modules:

  - Begin by upgrading the ```pip``` module to the latest version. Run the following command in your terminal:
  ```
  pip3 install --upgrade pip
  ```
 
 Then, download and unzip this repository to your computer. Once unzipped, navigate to the folder. For example, if the folder is located in your Downloads directory, use the following command to change to that directory:

  ```
  cd /home/[Your_Name]/Downloads/Crazyflie_RL-main
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
  It is recommended to connect the wandb module for logging and experiment tracking. Follow these steps:
  
  First, Sign Up (Create an account) on the [Wandb website](https://wandb.ai/site/). Next, run the following commands in your terminal to connect with the website:
 
  ```
  wandb login
  ```

  After running ```wandb login```, it will prompt you for your API key. You can find your API key under ```User Settings -> API Keys ``` on the [Wandb website](https://wandb.ai/site/). Copy the key and paste it into the terminal when prompted.

  </p>

  Note: If the command does not work, repeat the steps above until the issue is resolved or troubleshoot the issue.

  ### 4. Download the Crazyflie Firmware:

   Verify that ```git``` is installed by running:

  ```
  git --version
  ```

  If ```git``` is not installed, use the following commands to install it:

  ```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install git
  ```

  Next, create a folder where you want to download the firmware. Use the following commands to set up the directory and download the required files:
  I created the folder in my Documents

  ```
  cd /home/[Your_Name]/Documents
  mkdir crazyflie_doc
  cd crazyflie_doc
  ```

  #### Install the Dependencies:

  Let's follow the steps outlined in this [installation guide](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/blob/master/docs/building-and-flashing/build.md). Let's proceed together!
  
  ```
  sudo apt-get install make gcc-arm-none-eabi
  ```

  #### Tkinter Installation:

Verify that ```tkinter``` is installed by running:

  ```
  python3 -m tkinter
  ```

  If ```tkinter``` is not installed, use the following commands to install it:

  ```
  sudo apt install python3-tk
  ```

  If the installation is successful, you should see the following interface:

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e590f081-c63b-4665-8b51-2dfb0ffb7a84" align="center" width="250">
  </p>

  Press "QUIT".

  #### Clone the Firmware Repository:

  Download the Crazyflie firmware by running the following command:

  ```
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware.git
  ```

  Verify that the firmware has been downloaded by checking the created folder (crazyflie_doc).

  #### Initialize and Update Submodules:

  Run the following commands to initialize and update the submodules:

  ```
  cd crazyflie-firmware
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  ```

  Make sure no errors encountered

  #### Compile the Firmware:

  Compile the firmware using:

  ```
  make cf2_defconfig
  make -j$(nproc)
  ```

  If no errors occur, the setup is complete.
  
  ## Connecting the Crazyflie and Radio

  1. Connect the Crazyflie radio to your laptop or PC.
  2. Turn on the Crazyflie drone
  3. Verify communication between the drone and the radio:
     - Run the following command in the terminal:
     
      ```
      cfclient
      ```
  4. In the cfclient interface, press ```scan```. The interface should detect the radio and drone.
     - If the drone isn’t detected, enter the address manually by writing ```0xE7E7E7E7E7```. I changed mine, so the modified address is ```0xE7E7E7E704```.
     - press ```connect```.
     - If you move the drone, you will start to see changes in the ```Fligh Data``` part.
  5. We don't need this interface. The only thing we need to get from here is the Crazyflie radio and address information (e.g. ```'radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E7E7'```). We can close this interface.
     
## Final checks before Implementation

### Connecting with a crazyflie:

  Make sure ```cflib``` has been installed using command:

  ```
  pip3 show cflib
  ```
  
  If not, run the following command:

  ```
  pip3 install cflib
  ```
  
  Follow the steps given in the [Step-by-Step: Connecting, logging and parameters](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/user-guides/sbs_connect_log_param/) webpage to check if the Crazyflie is connected or not. Let's proceed together by writing a python code as follows:

  ```
  import logging
  import time
  
  import cflib.crtp
  from cflib.crazyflie import Crazyflie
  from cflib.crazyflie.syncCrazyflie import SyncCrazyflie
  
  # URI to the Crazyflie to connect to
  uri = 'radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E7E7'
  
  def simple_connect():
  
      print("Yeah, I'm connected! :D")
      time.sleep(3)
      print("Now I will disconnect :'(")
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      # Initialize the low-level drivers
      cflib.crtp.init_drivers()
  
      with SyncCrazyflie(uri, cf=Crazyflie(rw_cache='./cache')) as scf:
  
          simple_connect()
  ```

  If any error encountered, it is most probably from URI. Go back to ```cfclient``` interface and check the ```radio``` and ```address``` information and fix the code accordingly. For example, my URI is: ```uri = 'radio://0/100/2M/E7E7E7E704'```.

  If the code works properly, you will see commands below:
  
  ```
  Yeah, I'm connected! :D
  Now I will disconnect :'(
  ```

  ### Connecting with a Flow Deck:

  Flow Deck is a sensor that provides the detailed information about the position of the drone. We need to make sure it is connected. 
  Run the following code:

  ```
  import logging
  import sys
  import time
  from threading import Event
  
  import cflib.crtp
  from cflib.crazyflie import Crazyflie
  from cflib.crazyflie.syncCrazyflie import SyncCrazyflie
  from cflib.utils import uri_helper
  
  URI = uri_helper.uri_from_env(default='radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E7E7')
  
  deck_attached_event = Event()
  
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)
  
  def param_deck_flow(_, value_str):
      value = int(value_str)
      print(value)
      if value:
          deck_attached_event.set()
          print('Deck is attached!')
      else:
          print('Deck is NOT attached!')
  
  
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      cflib.crtp.init_drivers()
  
      with SyncCrazyflie(URI, cf=Crazyflie(rw_cache='./cache')) as scf:
  
          scf.cf.param.add_update_callback(group='deck', name='bcFlow2',
                                           cb=param_deck_flow)
          time.sleep(1)
  
  
  ```

If the FLow Deck connected properly, you will see commands below:

  ```
  Deck is attached!
  ```

More detailed infomration is provided in [Step-by-Step: Motion Commander](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/user-guides/sbs_motion_commander/).

### Simple Motion Test:

Before assigning specific tasks, test basic motions such as take-off, forward movement, backward movement, and landing. Place the drone in a safe, open area to prevent any accidents.

Run the following code:

  ```
import logging
import sys
import time
from threading import Event

import cflib.crtp
from cflib.crazyflie import Crazyflie
from cflib.crazyflie.syncCrazyflie import SyncCrazyflie
from cflib.positioning.motion_commander import MotionCommander
from cflib.utils import uri_helper

URI = uri_helper.uri_from_env(default='radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E7E7')

DEFAULT_HEIGHT = 0.5

deck_attached_event = Event()
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)


def move_linear_simple(scf):
    with MotionCommander(scf, default_height=DEFAULT_HEIGHT) as mc:
        time.sleep(1)
        mc.forward(0.5)
        time.sleep(1)
        mc.back(0.5)
        time.sleep(1)
        mc.land()

def param_deck_flow(_, value_str):
    value = int(value_str)
    print(value)
    if value:
        deck_attached_event.set()
        print('Deck is attached!')
    else:
        print('Deck is NOT attached!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cflib.crtp.init_drivers()

    with SyncCrazyflie(URI, cf=Crazyflie(rw_cache='./cache')) as scf:

        scf.cf.param.add_update_callback(group='deck', name='bcFlow2',
                                         cb=param_deck_flow)
        time.sleep(1)

        if not deck_attached_event.wait(timeout=5):
            print('No flow deck detected!')
            sys.exit(1)

        move_linear_simple(scf)
  ```

The other commands for the motion of the Crazyflie can be found in [motion_commander](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/api/cflib/positioning/motion_commander/) and [commander](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-lib-python/master/api/cflib/crazyflie/commander/) webpages.

### Logging while Flying:

To check the information of the position and oriantation of the Crazyflie, we need to have log to export and analyze it.

Run the following code, we can get the x, y and z position of the Crazyflie in real-time:

```
import logging
import sys
import time
from threading import Event

import cflib.crtp
from cflib.crazyflie import Crazyflie
from cflib.crazyflie.log import LogConfig
from cflib.crazyflie.syncCrazyflie import SyncCrazyflie
from cflib.positioning.motion_commander import MotionCommander
from cflib.utils import uri_helper


URI = uri_helper.uri_from_env(default='radio://0/80/2M/E7E7E7E707')

DEFAULT_HEIGHT = 0.5

deck_attached_event = Event()

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

position_estimate = [0, 0, 0]

def move_linear_simple(scf):
    with MotionCommander(scf, default_height=DEFAULT_HEIGHT) as mc:
        time.sleep(1)
        mc.land()


def log_pos_callback(timestamp, data, logconf):
    print(data)
    global position_estimate
    position_estimate[0] = data['stateEstimate.x']
    position_estimate[1] = data['stateEstimate.y']
    position_estimate[2] = data['stateEstimate.z']

            
def param_deck_flow(_, value_str):
  value = int(value_str)
  print(value)
  if value:
      deck_attached_event.set()
      print('Deck is attached!')
  else:
      print('Deck is NOT attached!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cflib.crtp.init_drivers()

    with SyncCrazyflie(URI, cf=Crazyflie(rw_cache='./cache')) as scf:

        scf.cf.param.add_update_callback(group='deck', name='bcFlow2',
                                         cb=param_deck_flow)
        time.sleep(1)

        logconf = LogConfig(name='Position', period_in_ms=10)
        logconf.add_variable('stateEstimate.x', 'float')
        logconf.add_variable('stateEstimate.y', 'float')
        logconf.add_variable('stateEstimate.z', 'float')
        scf.cf.log.add_config(logconf)
        logconf.data_received_cb.add_callback(log_pos_callback)

        if not deck_attached_event.wait(timeout=5):
            print('No flow deck detected!')
            sys.exit(1)

        logconf.start()

        move_linear_simple(scf)
        logconf.stop()
  ```

Also, if interested in Roll, Pitch and Yaw orienations of the Crazyflie, replace the position information with orientation, or use both.

```
def log_pos_callback(timestamp, data, logconf):
    print(data)
    global position_estimate
    position_estimate[0] = data['stabilizer.roll']
    position_estimate[1] = data['stabilizer.pitch']
    position_estimate[2] = data['stabilizer.yaw']

.
.
.

logconf = LogConfig(name='Stabilizer', period_in_ms=10)
logconf.add_variable('stabilizer.roll', 'float')
logconf.add_variable('stabilizer.pitch', 'float')
logconf.add_variable('stabilizer.yaw', 'float')
scf.cf.log.add_config(logconf)
logconf.data_received_cb.add_callback(log_pos_callback)
```

## Running the RL Environment

This work utilizes the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in both simulated and real-world Crazyflie environments to achieve stable hovering at a specified altitude.  

Download and unzip this repository. Once done, if it is in Downloads for example, write the command:

```
cd /home/[Your_Name]/Downloads/Crazyflie_RL-main
```

### Choosing the Environment

To train the PPO algorithm in the simulated Crazyflie environment, use the following command:

```
python train.py --task simulation
```


To train the PPO algorithm in the real-world Crazyflie environment, use this command:

```
python train.py --task real
```

### Setting the Target Altitude

To specify the desired altitude, use the following command:

```
python train.py --target_altitude 1.0
```

In the example above, the target altitude is set to 1 meter.

### Defining the Action Range

For safety, it is recommended to specify the maximum allowable velocity (±) for the Crazyflie's actions. Use the following command to define the range:

```
python train.py --action_range 0.20
```
In this example, the maximum velocity is set to 0.20 meters per second.

### Example of a Combined Command

A command that incorporates these parameters might look like this:

```
python train.py --task simulation --target_altitude 1.0 --action_range 0.20
```
### Modifying Additional Parameters

Other parameters can also be adjusted in a similar manner using command line arguments. Alternatively, they can be manually edited in the [arguments.py](./utils/arguments.py) file.


## How it works

### [train.py](train.py)

The [train.py](train.py) file is the main executable responsible for parsing the arguments defined in [arguments.py](./utils/arguments.py). It also initializes both the environment and RL algorithm using the parameters specified in the file.

### [arguments.py](./utils/arguments.py)

The [arguments.py](./utils/arguments.py) file defines a set of arguments intended to be parsed from the command line. These arguments are utilized by the [train.py](train.py) file to configure the RL algorithm and the Crazyflie environment. Detailed instructions for using the command line can be found in the ```Running the RL Environment``` section.

### [networks.py](./ppo/networks.py)

The [networks.py](./ppo/networks.py) file contains the neural network architectures for the policy and value function used in the PPO algorithm. Parameters for these neural networks can be adjusted either in the [arguments.py](./utils/arguments.py) file or directly via the command line.

### [ppo_agent.py](./ppo/ppo_agent.py)

The [ppo_agent.py](./ppo/ppo_agent.py) file implements the PPO algorithm and manages the training process.

### [crazyflie_env.py](./crazyflie_env/crazyflie_env.py)

The [crazyflie_env.py](./crazyflie_env/crazyflie_env.py) file defines the environment used for training with the PPO algorithm. It includes the ```reset()```, ```step()``` , and ```render()```  functions, supporting both ```simulation```  and ```real``` environments. This file specifies the observation space, action space, and reward function, all of which can be customized based on the task.
